# TODO
* Make API endpoint only accessable to localhost.
* fix the issue that bars users from reconnecting into their VM.
* add better error handling (rn whenever an error occurs, the user is just sent to `/undefined`.)
* make admin page to monitor and access all vm children.
* add some sort of cookies.
* make server run on nginx. Right now, it is ran by privlidged user. high security risk.
